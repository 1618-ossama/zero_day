Vagrant is an open-source software tool for building and managing virtual development environments. It allows developers to create a reproducible and isolated development environment that closely resembles a production environment. With Vagrant, developers can easily configure and provision virtual machines (VMs) using simple text files, automate the software installation process, and share the same environment across team members. Vagrant supports a wide range of virtualization providers such as VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V, and Docker. It also integrates with configuration management tools like Puppet, Chef, and Ansible to further streamline the development workflow.
